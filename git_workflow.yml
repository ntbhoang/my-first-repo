1- Workflow:
  - Modifier (Working directories) -> git add -> Staging Area -> git commit -> Committed Files -> git push -> Remote Repo
2- Before making changes, verify the status:
  - git status
  - git restore --stage file_name # unstage the file
  - git checkout -B feature/lesson
  - git branch # check the current branch

3- Remote vs local:
  - # create a local repository: mkdir my-first-repo
  - # goto the created dir, init git: git init
  - # connect local repo to centralize server: git remote
  - # cd back to the first-repo, copy the https
  - # add remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/ntbhoang/my-first-repo.git
  - # git pull 
  - # Now, we won't see anything, we need to set main branch to keep track with remote server: git checkout main
